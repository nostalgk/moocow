class="c10 doc-content"><p class="c7"><span class="c8 c9">Features Proposal</span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This features proposal for MooCOW (wip) is intended to lay out the features that we need to implement, and the features that would be nice to implement. </span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Core features are required for the game to run as a game. These involve overloading Evennia&rsquo;s command system to take new commands, handling logins appropriately, character creation, and core gameplay systems like inventory.</span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Need to Have features are required for the gameplay loop of the game in mind, and the game will be considered feature complete when all realistic features here have been implemented.</span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Nice to Have features are optional features to enrich the gameplay experience. These might entail more complex work, but will add to a better and more wholesome experience for the players. It&rsquo;s alright to work on these alongside Need to Have work, but only after Core work has been finished, and keeping in mind that it is lower priority. We can tackle these more strongly after our game is feature complete, and also can add them and more as title updates.</span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This document will be outlined per subject to allow for easier siloing of work for each featureset, i.e. player features, world features, combat, etc.</span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">All of these features are subject to change and we may very well find that it is difficult or virtually impossible to implement them. We should be prepared to adapt to these things on the fly, but this list should give us an idea of the priorities we should be working on. Before releasing the game to the public, we should have every needed feature fully built out; nice to have features can potentially wait until after release and added as updates.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Player Features</span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Core:</span></p><ul class="c3 lst-kix_5dpjexliq93r-0 start"><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Account creation, with a limit (not 1) on accounts per saved connection, as well as concurrent connection checks to ensure a lack of botting or exploiting alternate accounts.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">A persistent inventory, keeping track of player owned containers, physical player inventory, and carried containers as well. Player inventories should be immutable when logged out.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Persistent handling of player location to ensure that they log in back in the area they were previously.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Extended player commands based on Evennia&rsquo;s core commands. Players should be able to look at objects and in directions, examine held objects and objects in the world, and be able to see what commands are able to be taken with an object (potentially with some being hidden to encourage creativity). As of this writing, the core foundation is built in Evennia, but will need tweaks and extensions.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">A persistent stat and skill system for players. Skills and stats don&rsquo;t need to be implemented at this point in regards to calculating behaviors, but logic needs to be created to attach skills and stats to players. Basic EXP would be nice here.</span></li></ul><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Need to have:</span></p><ul class="c3 lst-kix_vs4mc75elu5v-0 start"><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Logic to create containers based on each of the player&rsquo;s hands (so they can hold things), as well as making the player&rsquo;s inventory itself a container with weight limits etc.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">A system to ensure that logged out players stay persistent in the world for a time after logging out, potentially indefinitely. This will remove the ability for players to exploit difficulty by logging out, and encourage players to find a safe place before ending their session.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">A transparent health system for players to measure how damaged they are, and be able to both heal damage as well as subtract health in combat etc. Health bars.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">A movement system that allows players to traverse at different rates based on environmental variables in both the rooms and their own characteristics. Swimming and potentially climbing should be part of this.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">A basic equipment system that allows players to wear things like clothes, armor, etc.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">A flag system that can assign different traits dynamically to individual players, to be used in further features.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8">Basic survival stats for the player that deteriorate at a constant rate. Hunger, thirst, radiation, that sort of thing. Buffs, debuffs, conditions etc should fit into this as well.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></li></ul><p class="c2 c6 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><ul class="c3 lst-kix_vs4mc75elu5v-0"><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">A more advanced stat and skill system that takes into account character EXP, quest EXP, and skill EXP, as well as intertwined modifiers for stats achieved by the player, and feats (learned through the world, not picked at level up). Ideally, feats, character and skill EXP will be allotted to a player based on the level they&rsquo;ve gained with their quest EXP, and will be finite in nature, to put more pressure on the player to specialize into builds. Potential stats and skills will be outlined in this document below.</span></li></ul><p class="c2 c6 c4"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Nice to have:</span></p><ul class="c3 lst-kix_1rgqihui733l-0 start"><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">A more advanced health system taking into account limb health, injuries, stress, mood, sickness, and specific conditions created by environmental factors or enemy attacks. Healing conditions should also take time and resources. Ideally, player Capacities such as breathing , sight, hearing and consciousness should be presented by percentages (not necessarily visible to the player) that will impact them in a variety of ways as they lower.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">A drug system, including both recreational and pharmaceutical drugs that will affect the player&rsquo;s stats and Capacities, along with the ability to become addicted as a condition with withdrawal debuffs.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Proper roles for social skills built into the game, so players can roleplay as a more passive and socially oriented character while still contributing to the overall gameplay loop for themselves and their peers. Things like cooking, brewing, farming, etc.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">More involved player conditions such as mood and stress that will be affected by most actions in the game, also giving more importance to social skills and roles. Players may need to find a way to relax after performing strenuous activities, or risk losing performance.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Some sort of mutation system that allows players to receive benefits and negatives that change their character, and even change &ldquo;races&rdquo; in order to enjoy a new dimension of gameplay. This may involve becoming overly mutated and no longer being able to use the default player towns, but gaining access to private parts of new areas; becoming a zombie, a vampire, a demon&hellip; things like that. Ideally, a player will need to accept a variety of traits and reach a threshold to be considered the new race, which will give them extra bonuses. These races should be a serious commitment and only reversible in rare cases, but players should be warned and given an opt-out before continuing down that path. I want this to be a &ldquo;need to have&rdquo; but it will require work.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Player &ldquo;knowledges&rdquo; that can be advanced through research and exposure to different things, that can give a better chance or success or a stat bonus to performing different activities. Books may be available to provide this as well, gaining bonuses to reading time and efficiency based on comfort. </span></li></ul><p class="c2 c6 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c7 c6 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0">World Features</span></p><p class="c7 c6 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Core: More probably needs to be identified here, but it is a fairly simple deal with MUDs.</span></p><ul class="c3 lst-kix_irb7eztfsdx7-0 start"><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">A template has been created for creating new rooms, allowing us to interconnect different rooms that can be moved between, as well as hopefully implementing verticality.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Implementing room exits in such a way that adjacent rooms can hopefully dynamically generate exits in rooms that connect to them.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The ability to populate world objects in a room, such as a vent, stairs, etc.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Traits for different rooms that affect the environmental circumstances of them, such as a room being indoors vs outside.</span></li></ul><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Need to have:</span></p><ul class="c3 lst-kix_4lwxymeo477i-0 start"><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Ability for rooms to appear different based on light level, hearing, etc. Darkness should have to be confronted before players can take actions based on their environment. Potentially a memory system could be created so players can remember where to move when senses are impaired if they&rsquo;ve been to an area before.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">A day and night cycle along with a time system that changes light levels and temperature as time goes on. This may affect the world (shops closing)</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">A map system, preferably with coordinates; this should both speed up room creation, allow players to navigate and share their location easier, and tie into different mechanics.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Respawn points for the players (likely cloning computers) functioning as intended with a memory chip system; chips will not automatically update in all circumstances, requiring players to save their progress periodically or risk losing progress as a form of difficulty.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Mapped out traits for different rooms we can think of, to apply blanket and make room creation easier and more interesting.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Room description systems have been built out according to what we&rsquo;d like, potentially with some dynamic text based on environmental details. Items in the vicinity should also be labeled.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Container logic for things like boxes, drawers, dropped player containers, etc. They should be able to be opened and closed, with players able to look at them to determine what&rsquo;s inside when they&rsquo;re open. </span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">General world design mapped out and implemented.. My idea is that we just pretty much rip off Dark Souls wholesale, swamp in the blighttown area, coastal city in the New Londo area, etc.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Safer (not entirely safe) areas for players to exchange rent currency to have a safe room to themselves, where items do not despawn and they can safely return.</span></li></ul><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c2 c6 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><ul class="c3 lst-kix_4lwxymeo477i-0"><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Dropped item logic built out and implemented, so that player items degrade on the ground and NPC items disappear at a faster rate to prevent clutter from people grinding mobs. Room inventories should be able to extend beyond what the player initially sees to make a more concise description, with the ability for players to see a full list of items on demand.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Dungeons, like old world bunkers, where players can find loot. At this point as well, loot should be generally understood and mapped out so that players have a general cycle.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Quests should be designed, even if the NPCs giving them haven&rsquo;t quite been created. Simple dynamic quests should be possible to give players a steady drip of quest EXP and ability to generate currency, as well as intentional unique quests that unlock new features and special loot with more lore to them.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">As a final part of the world feature design, writing and lore has been implemented so specific areas in our game have themes and designs for what players might go to them for, what they can do in them, and the threats they may face. Environmental factors should be just as dangerous as enemies lurking in them, like steep hills, bodies of water, radiation, etc</span></li></ul><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Nice to have:</span></p><ul class="c3 lst-kix_2trf801i6goo-0 start"><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">A weather system that progresses over time, with different areas having different cycles of weather. Some of these weathers may be threatening, like acid rain that can degrade equipment, or nuclear blowouts that can irradiate and kill players, making some areas more threatening without either special equipment or speedy execution.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Dynamic quests powered by AI, either outside of the game and implemented by us or purely dynamic through a model placed in the game, that allow for interesting writing and motivations to be generated on the fly. This is a very large stretch goal that can safely be put on the chopping block, but would be pretty cool.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Raids, very difficult areas that are intended to be explored by groups of players in order to overcome significant challenges that respawn on a larger timer and close for a time when players have exited them or achieved their goals.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Player housing that allows players to build their own rooms in specific areas to act as a home or a business. This is actually not that tough to do on the whole, as MUDs already support players creating rooms, but it will require integration with many other mechanics across the board to be meaningful.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8">An actually interestingly written world that has lore that will pique people&rsquo;s interest while still being outrageously funny. The Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Apocalypse.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></li></ul><p class="c6 c7"><span class="c0">NPC Features</span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Core:</span></p><ul class="c3 lst-kix_8jnbsghf5dq3-0 start"><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">A basic NPC system, built off of the player class for human/mostly human NPCs and separate classes for monsters and wildlife. Human-like mobs do not necessarily have to have the complex systems a player might need to manage, but human NPCs should, to an extent. At its core, however, this does not need to be implemented more than simply turning off or providing infinite solutions to those class features.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">NPC pathing that allows NPCs to navigate between rooms to an extent. This is mostly already built into Evennia.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The ability to talk to NPCs and have them respond to keywords and actions.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The ability for an NPC to trade items with a player, or using an alternative system (an NPC running a kiosk, in case they are murdered by a bad intentioned player)</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Respawn logic for NPCs and mobs in case they are killed. Which is likely.</span></li></ul><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Need to have:</span></p><ul class="c3 lst-kix_9ecid0ktzvba-0 start"><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Tables for NPC trading that repopulate items over time and allow for players to sell items to the NPC/kiosk inventory.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The ability for NPCs to hold a conversation based on keywords; an NPC should respond to generic hailing with a monologue that contains their keywords, and NPCs should have dialogue trees using multiple keywords to advance the dialogue.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The ability for NPCs to issue quests and complete them upon the player fulfilling the requirements, if necessary. This includes issuing quest items to players and taking them, as well as cross-NPC quest functionality. </span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">NPC needs that are fulfilled dynamically as part of their behaviors. NPCs should get hungry and thirsty, and go fulfill these needs by grabbing food and water from restaurants etc. NPCs do not need to experience all the needs of a player, but they may experience things like sickness that can be spread to other players. Fun!</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">NPC factions with reputation systems that can grow as the player does more for them, causing NPCs that are part of that faction to respond differently to players with an active reputation. This may unlock quests etc.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">NPC reaction groups, like police and guards in towns. These should generally be robots and triggered by surveillance, and not have jurisdiction outside of their given areas.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">NPC traits that measure whether or not they are hostile, etc. Many mobs, even human-like ones, don&rsquo;t necessarily have to be interactable outside of combat. But it would be fun to have them respond to things like insults. NPC hostility should generally not trigger immediately as a player enters the room (to give them room to navigate or get away), but should possibly occur as a result of poor negotiation or staying around them too long.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">NPC abilities that can cause status effects, special attacks, that kind of thing. Some of these should need to be avoided by using specific actions, i.e. ducking under a laser beam or something like that. Could be fun for raid bosses.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">By release, all important NPCs should be created, as well as the general population in places like cities. NPCs can be identified by numbers with their name as well, in case of duplicates. Boss NPCs should be implemented, and enemy stats should be distributed.</span></li></ul><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Nice to have:</span></p><ul class="c3 lst-kix_51k7avwojy9m-0 start"><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Wandering NPCs like merchants that will cross large swaths of the world to be tracked down by players for things like unique items.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">World bosses that will spawn over longer periods of time, causing identified players to receive a notification they&rsquo;ve spawned. Defeating these should yield unique loot and rare items.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">More advanced NPC systems that mimic the player&rsquo;s, such as sickness. The reason this is in this category is that it would require significant balancing for implementing each player feature to an NPC, but as NPCs are built off of the player class, it shouldn&rsquo;t be hard to actually program into an NPC.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Bounty hunters that will spawn in the world and track down specific players if they&rsquo;ve pissed off a faction or belong to a specific race and have been spotted.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Generic NPCs able to hook into the aforementioned dynamic quest system, allowing simple NPCs like citizens to give players basic jobs to do (find me an item, kill this thing, etc). These don&rsquo;t need to give players quest EXP, to make it more finite, but it should give them the ability to gain basic items and currency with low difficulty jobs. Rare items can occur&hellip; rarely.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Being able to ally with nearly any faction, and those faction reputations also affecting adjacent factions. Allying with Hell should probably piss off the church. And most people.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Ramshackle corporations with a vested interest in market forces, and potentially allowing these to be player owned with NPC employees. And corporate sabotage.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">NPC henchmen that are able to follow the player and protect them, refusing to enter certain areas due to having a functional sense of risk management. Like not wanting to die.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8">Creatable allied &ldquo;hojunkuli&rdquo; by combining biological matter with junk materials. Also robots.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></li></ul><p class="c2 c6 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Social Features</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Core:</span></p><ul class="c3 lst-kix_k1pf224zff6x-0 start"><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">A player mail system that allows players to send messages to each other regardless of where they are in the world.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Basic chat channel organization set up, so players are able to communicate in groups, subscribe and unsubscribe from channels.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">A more extensive system for players to talk to each other out loud, emote, communicate. Not necessarily feature complete, but necessities done at this stage.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Friend system for players to keep track of people they enjoy meeting. Friends.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Block system that prevents players from being able to mail or appear in chat rooms to the person who blocked them. In-world communication must still be possible to an extent, just for clarity&rsquo;s sake and to prevent something like a player not knowing a blocked person is gonna sneak up on them and shank them.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The ability for players to be able to trade items. This can be as simple as handing a player items one at a time, with the trade command requiring an item or currency in exchange with a warning a la runescape.</span></li></ul><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Need to have:</span></p><ul class="c3 lst-kix_5m8ijnxu21b5-0 start"><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">A player clan system with benefits for being in a clan, such as a building in the main town they can organize in, and their own chat channel generated upon creation. Clans should be able to engage in sanctioned and organized fights without repercussions, allowing clans to be an opt-in for more PvP; perhaps in a declared war.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">A party system that allows players to party up and track each other to a degree, so it is easier to find each other. Partying should allow for players to participate in dynamic quests together; if a quest spawns a particular enemy for a player to fight, the enemy should only be aggro&rsquo;d and fightable by the player themselves and their party. With shared EXP rules.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">A more complex emote system built into the game that allows players to perform more complex interactions like waving and such, supported by the game without being put into the custom emote system. This will allow characters to interact with each other more fruitfully, i.e. beckon someone to follow you, threaten them, etc. Things like sitting on a chair would probably fall into this category, and should update the player&rsquo;s description in the room to make them part of the environment.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">A basic player economy system allowing for a player marketplace where they can trade items in relative safety, perhaps spread across towns with varying degrees of safety. </span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">A skill system for players that takes into account social roles and allows for players to take a more passive role in the game while enjoying progression (i.e. skilling in runescape)</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">An art system, allowing players to create art (sculptures, music (mixtapes? lol), paintings) that will tie into the comfort system and allow for player housing to provide bonuses with art in it.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">A cooking system for both food and drugs for players to aid people playing the combat cycle.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">A farming system for people to produce food and resources for other skillers, and to just have a little garden :)</span></li></ul><p class="c2"><span class="c5"><br>Nice to have:</span></p><ul class="c3 lst-kix_3l744xjvetc5-0 start"><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8">A more complex art system, a la Dwarf Fortress, that randomly creates art when performing art skills based on what a player has seen or experienced. Also, the ability to create morbid art that stresses players out (or perhaps un-stresses certain morbid characters). Perhaps based off the player Knowledge system.</span></li></ul></body></html>
