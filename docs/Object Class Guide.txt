Object Class Guide


The point of this part of the design documents is to lay out a general orientation for how different objects should be classified in JSON.


These bases should be used as templates for different item categories that are added to the game. These will be revised as needed; these are merely a current baseline to give us an idea of the attributes of a given object and what features we should design around.


In order to get these entered into Evennia in a way that the game engine can properly associate with the game in order to create database entries for each item, we’ll need to convert these to Python dictionaries. That being said, that shouldn’t stop you from creating them as you please; we’ll find a way to mass import them easily, as it’s not a difficult job.


For inspiration, I’ve grabbed these from Cataclysm DDA (an open source game that’s good if you’re into this sort of thing!). They’re mostly formatted the way we’d like, but will require some sanitization to get to the current system below. If you’d like to add an item without the overhead, here is the item library from Cataclysm: 
















































































Gun Characteristics Table


tag
	description
	id
	Game reference ID for the object / primary key for object in DB
	type
	Determines the base actions available with an object. Almost always GUN in this case.
	name
	The name of the item as shown to the player, on the ground and in their inventory etc
	description
	Examine description for the player, that appears when performing a detailed examination.
	weight
	Weight of the item, used in encumbrance and container limits.
	longest_side
	Used to determine if the item will fit in a container, given the depth of the container
	trader_price
	How much it sells for from an NPC trader
	to_hit
	Currently a bit ambitious, but with the idea that the characteristics of a weapon affect its overall hit chance, also taking your skill and equipment encumbrance into effect
	material
	What the weapon is made out of. Materials contribute to the overall stats of a given object, but most guns cannot be fabricated the way other objects can, so this is mostly static.
	symbol
	ASCII art symbol shown next to the object to differentiate it at a glance.
	color
	Color of the object, used when being examined or examining oneself
	ammo
	Ammunition needed for the weapon to function
	needed
	Requirements to wield as a weapon or tool effectively
	ranged_damage
	Contains a list of damage objects, their floors, and their ceilings. Weapons do a range of damage, with higher skill levels causing damage closer to the ceiling than the floor, and vice versa with lower skill.
	flags
	Flags for the item used for various purposes. 
	category
	Determines some basic things about the object, and more importantly, the flavor text that appears when using it as a weapon for attacks in combat.
	durability
	The durability of the item in question. For guns this is rarely going to change unless there is a sort of modification, but with other objects, materials can contribute to this factor before the object is created into JSON.
	jam_chance
	The base chance for a gun to jam when fired. Increases when using different fire types, decreases or increases based on durability, decreases minorly based on skill.
	modes
	Fire modes of the weapon. These typically fire more rounds in a given action, but increase the chance of both missing per shot, and jamming.
	valid_mod_locations
	Determines where mods can be installed on a weapon. Not worth going overboard on this, but can be fun to mix and match different combinations.
	pocket_data
	A container specific to certain objects that allows for certain items to be carried inside the object. In this case, for guns, it is typically the magazine storing the ammo.

Melee Characteristics Table


tag
	description
	id
	Game reference ID for the object / primary key for object in DB
	type
	Determines the base actions available with an object. GENERIC objects can generally be crafted, TOOL objects perform a special function, and GENERIC_TOOL objects are crafted tools.
	name
	The name of the item as shown to the player, on the ground and in their inventory etc
	description
	Examine description for the player, that appears when performing a detailed examination. Adds on a string based on the material if it is a generic item.
	weight
	Weight of the item, used in encumbrance and container limits.
	longest_side
	Used to determine if the item will fit in a container, given the depth of the container
	trader_price
	How much it sells for from an NPC trader
	to_hit
	Currently a bit ambitious, but with the idea that the characteristics of a weapon affect its overall hit chance, also taking your skill and equipment encumbrance into effect
	material
	What the weapon is made out of. Materials contribute to the overall stats of a given object; heavier materials favor blunt weapons, sharper and lighter materials favor sharp weapons. Regardless, people can make whatever they want.
	symbol
	ASCII art symbol shown next to the object to differentiate it at a glance.
	color
	Color of the object, used when being examined or examining oneself
	ammo

	Requirements to wield as a weapon or tool effectively
	melee_damage
	Contains a list of damage objects, their floors, and their ceilings. Weapons do a range of damage, with higher skill levels causing damage closer to the ceiling than the floor, and vice versa with lower skill.

	pocket_data
	A container specific to certain objects that allows for certain items to be carried inside the object. May be used with a battery, for example, for a special weapon.
	[tool]_efficiency
	Governs how efficient this object is as a tool. Some weapons can perform as mediocre tools, and vice versa.
	coverage
	An item with the COVERS flag will occupy clothing space as well. This governs how much space it takes up, and the encumbrance it adds.
