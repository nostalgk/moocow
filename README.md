# MooCOW
Hello, and welcome to the development discord for the game, MooCOW (working title)

> What is MooCOW?

MooCOW is an Object Oriented Multi-User Dungeon (MOO/MUD). Mainly focusing on RPG mechanics and social interaction, MooCOW takes place in a world devastated by some sort of apocalypse. The United States government created a brain scanning and cloning technology in case of an emergency, to help repopulate and rebuild society. You play as one of these clones, ideally, working to restore democracy to a shattered nation.

> How is that going?

Terribly! Frankly, no one gives a shit about rebuilding the United States, and why should they? Fuck it. Hobo world.

Everyone has collectively decided that it would be a lot cooler to just live in a post apocalyptic world, especially when the government's emergency relief technology inadvertently solved the problem of death itself. Have fun, and enjoy the apocalypse; just don't forget to update your cortex chip.

> What can I expect from this game?

A rich survival and simulation focused RPG, with titillating ASCII visuals and groundbreaking modern gameplay inspired by the likes of Zork and Rogue. Learn new skills as you brave the wastelands and contribute to a dynamic, player focused world. Explore pre-war buildings and learn what the world was like, and what happened. Build a shack in the woods and go insane as you abuse recreational drugs to become the best bartender in the wasteland. Drop a cluster nuke on the last remains of civilization. The world is your toilet.

> Sick. Hobo With a Shotgun is my favorite movie. How can I help?

Check out our Github at [I'm a lazy piece of shit and haven't made a GitHub yet] and feel free to submit new issues or tackle them yourself to add to our game! MooCOW is an open source framework for creating RPG focused MUDs, and the hope is that with the features we create, you'll be able to import our work and create your own spin using the systems of this game.

> When will this be released?

Never.
